# PuzzleSolver
this is the final product of a college project we worked on for most of the semester.
the task was to remake our puzzle solving app in android studio.
the app has three puzzles you can solve with standard button user input, as well as solvers to each puzzle finding the optimal solution from a starting point.
the puzzles and solvers were created by extending the framework of the Problem class, given to us by our instructor. the same approach was used to create the solvers,
with Graphs.
